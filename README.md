### **Goals for the School Year**
My goals for this school year is to at least get a 3 or higher on all my AP exams.
### **Volunteer Work or Community Service**
One thing I volunteered for over the summer was to clean up the beach. I learned that there was a lot more hidden trash in places people refuse to look and a lot of trash left behind gets stuck in the rocks.
